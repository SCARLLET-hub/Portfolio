1. **Install Jekyll**: Make sure you have Ruby and Bundler installed. Then install Jekyll with the following command:

   ```bash
   gem install jekyll bundler
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Code-Contribution.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the repository directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Code-Contribution
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**: Install the required dependencies using Bundler:

   ```bash
   bundle install
